*** lxpanel (Lubuntu or Madbox) gtk2 file : /gtk-2.0/apps/panel.rc
The calendar show a white border impossible to colorize or hide ! Help me, please...

*** Ubuntu ***
The only way to change a theme in Ubuntu 12.04LTS is to install Ubuntu-tweak:
  http://ubuntu-tweak.com/

*** nautilus ***
When you right clic on a folder or a file, then properties and permissions, the owner is not well displayed. If we fix it in line106 of the gtk-widgets.css file, we have issues elsewhere. So the solution must be in the /apps/nautilus.css file. But don't know how after a few hours of searching...

*** Unity 2D ***
Buttons in the global menu that appears too dark.. (must be a bug in Unity2D)

*** Xubuntu and Compiz ***
If you use compiz, you have to install gconf-editor and launch it:
  sudo apt-get install gconf-editor
  gconf-editor

In "apps/metacity/general", modify the value of "theme" to "03-Crunchy-blue", "04-Crunchy-grey" or "05-Crunchy-green"
  compiz --replace

and now you'll have the right window decorator.

*** Gnome-Shell ***
You'll have to install the gconf-editor as described for Xubuntu to install the theme.
As said before, you'll have to identify the theme for metacity.
Perhaps you'll have to do it for "desktop/gnome/interface" too (gtk_theme).
The specific theme for gnome-shell is only in blue (from Ambiance-blue)

*** Madbox ***
It's an Openbox theme but to have the gnome-mplayer with the right theme:
  * Open the file: /home/<login-name>/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini and change the name of the theme
