Those are my dotfiles, mostly used by me to sync my configuration on all my machines.

In order to make proper use of the .conkyrc you need to run dwm-dan.

For the gtk theme you will need the gtk-murrine engine.

You also need to install the following packages/programs to use all the dotfiles:
 * Base system (CLI): zsh tmux vim curl
 * Base system - Addition: Additionally, you will need http://ctags.sf.net to run vim properly
 * Graphical system (GUI): dwm roxterm gtk2-engines-murrine conky-cli
 * Graphical system - Addition: Additionally, you will need https://github.com/omnidan/dwm-dan
